Day 1 Assignment

Task 1 :Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Because HTTP/1.1 relies on the transport layer to avoid buffer overflow, 
each new TCP connection requires a separate flow control mechanism. HTTP/2, 
however, multiplexes streams within a single TCP connection, 
and will have to implement flow control in a different manner

Task 2 : objects and its internal representation in Javascript
In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, 
including other objects. 
Objects are used to represent real-world entities, data structures, and more complex data types

IP Address:

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network.
It serves two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
There are two versions of IP addresses in use today: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit).

Port:
In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint.
Ports are used by protocols in the transport layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
Ports are identified by numbers, with well-known ports (0-1023) reserved for specific protocols and purposes, and dynamic or private ports (1024-49151) available for general use.

HTTP Methods:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods are the actions that can be performed on a resource identified by a URL.
Some common HTTP methods include:
GET: Retrieve data from the server.
POST: Submit data to the server.
PUT: Update a resource on the server.
DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
PATCH: Partially update a resource on the server.
These methods define the semantics of the operation requested and are an essential part of the HTTP protocol.

MAC Address:
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communications at the data link layer of a network segment.
MAC addresses are typically assigned by the manufacturer of the network interface and are stored in the hardware.
They are used for routing data within a network segment and are not typically routed across network boundaries like IP addresses.
